# README for Texture Diffusion Project

## Overview
This project implements a diffusion model for generating images using a custom dataset of Minecraft textures. The model leverages a U-Net architecture and includes functionality for both forward and reverse diffusion processes.

## Project Structure
The project consists of the following files:

- `dataset_loader.py`: Defines the `MinecraftTextureDataset` class for loading Minecraft texture images.
- `diffusion_process.py`: Contains the `DiffusionModel` class, which implements the diffusion process for image generation.
- `unet.py`: Defines the `UNet` class, which serves as the neural network architecture for the diffusion model.
- `train.py`: Implements the training loop for the diffusion model using the dataset and model defined in the existing files.
- `README.md`: Documentation for the project, including setup instructions and usage.

## Installation
To set up the project, ensure you have Python and the required libraries installed. You can install the necessary packages using pip:

```bash
pip install torch torchvision tqdm
```

## Usage
1. **Prepare the Dataset**: Place your Minecraft texture images in a directory structure that the `MinecraftTextureDataset` class can access. The dataset loader is designed to look for `.png` files.

2. **Train the Model**: Run the training script to start training the diffusion model. The script will load the dataset, initialize the model, and begin the training loop.

```bash
python train.py
```

3. **Generate Images**: After training, you can use the `DiffusionModel` class to generate new images based on the learned diffusion process.

## Notes
- Ensure that your dataset is large enough for effective training.
- You may need to adjust hyperparameters in `train.py` for optimal performance based on your specific dataset and hardware.
